# CirclePackingJS

[Project Page](https://amritamar.github.io/project/circlepacking/)

A fun mini-project because I like circles.

This was a tiny project I made cause circles are cool! Wikipedia has a great explanation on how to [pack circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing). The source for circle packing is [here](https://editor.p5js.org/AmritAmar/sketches/UVXX94iTP) and for the image version, [here](https://editor.p5js.org/AmritAmar/sketches/oL0gKBOyS)! Feel free to try out different parameters and images in the browser (just change imgSource to point to another picture). Warning - can lag on really big images with different parameters!
